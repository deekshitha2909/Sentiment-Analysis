# Sentiment Analysis Of Amazon Reviews Using SparkML

The primary goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using PySpark's SparkML library. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in textual data, in this case, Amazon customer reviews. The project aims to provide insights into customer opinions and sentiments about various products on the Amazon platform.

Key Steps and Components:

Data Collection:
Gather a dataset of Amazon product reviews. This dataset should include text reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the text data, including tasks such as removing stopwords, handling missing values, and tokenization.

Feature Extraction:
Utilize PySpark's SparkML library to convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Word Embeddings.

Model Training:
Selecting an appropriate machine learning model for sentiment analysis, such as a classification algorithm. Training the model using the preprocessed and transformed data.

Model Evaluation:
Assessed the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall. Use a separate dataset for testing to ensure unbiased evaluation.

Visualization and Interpretation:
Visualized the results and insights gained from the sentiment analysis. This includes generating charts, graphs, or reports to communicate the sentiment distribution and patterns within the Amazon reviews.

Optimization and Scaling:
Optimized the SparkML pipeline for efficiency, considering factors such as processing speed and resource utilization. Explored options for scaling the solution to handle larger datasets.
